<h1>Greetings for the new academic year.</h1>
I feel really elated to note the
achievements of this great institution.
The past few months have all brought
good news. We have had international
collaboration, TEQIP-II grant has
been approved, new seats and
programs have been sanctioned by
AICTE, above all, GNDEC ranked as
the first choice amongst the upcoming
engineers as was witnessed by the
heavy rush during the admission
process. All this has been possible by
the contributions made by each and
every member of GNDEC family. All
deserve kudos for the same. As the
new session picks up, new challenges
await: NBA accreditation, UGC visit.
But with the kind of dedication we
have, I am sure we shall reach greater
heights.
<br><br>
Director
