<h1><u>Editor’s message</u></h1>
<p>
<h2>“All of us have the ability to delve deep into the realms of our minds and find some treasures there, which really are our impressions about this world as well as our experiences. Some of them are turned into beautiful expressions by the creative-minded. Though a gem may be unpolished but it can be spotted by the expert.”
</h2><br>Dear Students, Faculty and Alumni,
<br><br>This online college magazine is just a little way to help you gain and share knowledge and specially to help you voice your literary insight through articles, poems, discussions and debates. As you tour through this website you will read poems and articles on latest technology, world cultures to sports, health and fitness and lot more. You can “comment”,”like” and even “share” your own articles on topics you consider important. What’s more, be ready to get your cameras, play with your imagination and do some awesome photography which you can share and also see other people’s work in the photo gallery.
<br><br>All this and much more will help you in a way to discover and develop your potential.
<br><br>Friends, 											
<br><br>hope sustains, dreams still pulsate and get translated- faith still manifests our heart. As each day offers us many opportunities to feel, think, learn and improve, we must reincarnate the talents each one of us has been gifted with.
